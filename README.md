## Google Search Fixer (Add-On)

Override the `User-Agent` string presented to Google's Search pages to receive the
search experience shown to Chrome on Firefox on mobile / tablet.

To download and install either 

1.
### Download from official Firefox Add-On page: 
<https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/google-search-fixer/>

Or 2. `git clone` the repo, and build it yourself with your preferred tools & toolchain such as Node.Js, Node.Js LTS, npm, npx, yarn, pnpm, Deno. 
For an extension **maybe** Webpack, ExpressJS, Gulp, Grunt could be used.

ESLint is highly recommended, TSLint is inferior, but better than nothing
